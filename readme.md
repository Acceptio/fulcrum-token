## About the Fulcrum (FULC) Utility Token
The FULC is our native settlements token used across our marketplace, and will enable many important functions within the Accept global marketplace including:
A medium of exchange (settlements) for Accept.io buyers and sellers
A consumptive use (utility) token for marketplace users to access premium features in the Accept.io DApp
An incentive for users to help improve the Accept Marketplace and contribute to the long-term development of Accept.io
					
## Accept’s Unique Value Propositions

The Accept.io self-regulating marketplace is primarily powered by:
i) Native dispute resolution processes to protect both buyers and sellers from fraud or dishonest behavior, and
ii) Innovative incentives for user participation in the growth and maintenance of the marketplace.
 
There are at least six reasons why buyers and sellers will want to join such a marketplace.

### 1. The Ability to Carry Out Non-monetary Transactions (with no fees)

Thanks to our sophisticated smart contract technology, Accept Marketplace users can freely trade their skills or goods they no longer need in exchange for other goods or services available in the Accept Marketplace. Users can also arrange complex transactions involving any combination of goods and services. As long as no money changes hands, the transaction is completely free.
Accept.io users trade with other users, without intermediaries, while maintaining transaction security. The Accept Marketplace introduces the most basic form of transaction (bartering) to the global online marketplace, with the addition of improved transaction speed and security over traditional payment systems.
 
### 2. Faster Settlements With Native Dispute Resolution and Payment Assurance

Today’s top freelancing platforms apply a 5-business-day security hold at the end of every contract. Then it takes 3-5 business days for funds to reach your bank account. In Accept.io, settlements are almost instantaneous.
When both parties agree to end a contract, the funds appear in the service provider’s Fulcrum wallet in seconds. These funds can be used in the Accept Marketplace or transferred to an external cryptocurrency exchange or wallet.
 
### 3. A Platform for the Unbanked

Anyone with an internet connection should be able to carry out freelance work or trade online. But many people in developing countries don’t have access to online marketplaces because they don’t have a bank account where they can deposit their earnings. In fact, 20-39% of the world’s population doesn’t have access to a bank account, so there’s a lot of untapped talent.
Anyone with an internet connection can use the Accept Marketplace and get paid in FULC, which can be spent in the marketplace or transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet.
 
### 4. Lower Contract Fees

Popular freelancing platforms like Upwork charge as much as 20% for every contract. This 20% fee invites competition from platforms like Accept.io that can connect hirers and freelancers much more efficiently.
Accept takes a small 2.5% fee from every contract (no matter what size). In addition to the 2.5% fee, buyers and sellers will also have to pay the Ethereum network fee, which is about US$0.50 on average.15
Accept.io will make it easy and cost-effective for anyone, regardless of skill level, to benefit from trading their skills for extra money or things they need.
 
### 5. A Decentralized, Self-Regulating Marketplace

Accept.io handles all disputes by incentivizing user participation in the maintenance of our network. All disputes are dealt with by accredited FULC token holders who qualify for our dispute resolution team called the Star Chamber. A Star Council is formed at random (from Star Chamber members) to vote on the resolution of the dispute, and the outcome is decided by majority vote. Star Council participants receive a small fee (paid in FULC) for helping to resolve disputes.
But we’re also working to reduce the frequency of disputes. Blockchain gives developers the power to ‘tokenize’ almost anything. Many of the problems with today’s popular online marketplaces can be solved with the tokenization, or monetization, of reputation.
Trust between freelancers and employers is a constant issue. Too often, employers or freelancers don’t treat each other fairly. This leads to arbitration, which is expensive and time consuming. A cryptocurrency, like Fulcrum, paired with smart contracts can incentivize fair and professional behavior in online marketplaces.
 
### 6. Open-Source Technology Development

Accept.io will be developed as a completely open-source platform available through the MIT software license. Users will be able to participate in the growth and management of the network in several ways:
Any user with programming experience can contribute to the further development of Accept.io by taking on challenges created by the Accept.io Leadership Team
Accredited users can help resolve contract disputes by serving in the Star Chamber, our native dispute resolution platform
Entrepreneurial members can start their own Marketplace Node to create a new Accept Marketplace for their local economy
All users receive a unique referral code they can share with friends and acquaintances to unlock rewards
